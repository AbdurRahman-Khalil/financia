Thatâ€™s an awesome project idea! ðŸŽ‰ Building a finance tracker app is a great way to practice web or mobile development while learning about state management, UI design, and working with data.

Hereâ€™s a roadmap and feature list tailored to a beginner-friendly app:

Core Features to Include
Add Income & Expense:

A simple form to manually add transactions.
Fields:
Amount
Category (e.g., Food, Travel, Utilities)
Date
Type (Income or Expense)
Notes (Optional)
Transaction List:

Display a list of all transactions.
Include filters for Income, Expenses, or All.
Dashboard Summary:

Show basic financial summaries:
Total Income
Total Expense
Remaining Balance (Income - Expense)
Use simple charts like a pie chart to visualize expenses by category.
Budget:

Set a monthly budget limit.
Display progress (e.g., "You've spent 70% of your budget").
Data Persistence:

Use LocalStorage (for a browser app) or SQLite/AsyncStorage (for a mobile app) to save data so it remains after refreshing the page or reopening the app.
Responsive Design:

Make it work on both desktop and mobile screens.
Optional Add-Ons (If Time Allows)
Date Filters:

Allow users to filter transactions by specific dates or months.
Recurring Transactions:

Add an option to repeat certain expenses (e.g., rent, subscriptions).
Export Data:

Let users download their transactions as a CSV file.
Authentication:

Add a login/signup feature to store user data securely.
Dark Mode:

Implement a toggle for light/dark mode for improved UI experience.
Categories Management:

Allow users to add or delete custom categories.
Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend:

Use React (if youâ€™re practicing web development).
For mobile: Use React Native or Flutter.
Use TailwindCSS or CSS Modules for styling (keep it simple).
State Management:

For beginners: Use useState and useEffect.
Intermediate: Try Zustand or Redux.
Backend (Optional):

Node.js with Express: Build APIs to save data in a database.
MongoDB: For storing transactions (or use Firebase for ease of setup).
Beginner Alternative: Start without a backend and save data locally.
Charts/Visuals:

Use Chart.js or Recharts for displaying financial summaries visually.
Deployment:

Frontend: Use Vercel or Netlify for quick deployment.
Backend: Use Render or Railway.
Basic App Flow
Home Page (Dashboard):

Show total balance, income, and expense.
Include a button to add new transactions.
Add Transaction Page/Modal:

A form to input transaction details.
Transactions Page:

List of all transactions with filters.
Settings Page (Optional):

Allow users to set budgets or enable dark mode.
Beginner Challenges to Focus On
Form Handling: Learn how to collect and validate user inputs.
State Management: Manage app state effectively for income, expenses, and summaries.
Data Persistence: Ensure that transactions donâ€™t disappear after refreshing.
Responsive Design: Practice creating layouts that work on any screen size.
Next Steps
Plan: Sketch out your app's UI on paper or a tool like Figma.
Start Small: Begin with just adding and displaying transactions.
Iterate: Gradually add more features like filtering, budget, and charts.
Refactor: Optimize your code as you learn.
